The purpose of mining is to introduce new cryptocurrency tokens into circulation.  It uses complex computers in order to solve complex, computationally-heavy mathematical problems. It has s been likened to modern version of the California gold rush, because it requires miners to do costly, meticulous work for erratic rewards. Mining is attractive to people because it allows one to gain cryptocurrency tokens without paying for them with money.

Mining serves the general public by monitoring, validating, and legitimizing cryptocurrency transactions. Since there is no central authority to oversee cryptocurrency, the responsibility is spread across many miners globally.

One way in which “fraud” occurs with cryptocurrency is through copying a token, sending the copy to a vendor, and retaining the original. Physical currency has all sorts of deterrents to keep people from printing more of their own, but the online version of currency is a little more complex. Miners do work as auditors for the blockchain to prevent the duplication of cryptocurrency.

Tokens are a miner’s reward for completing “blocks” which are added to the blockchain. A block is about 1 megabyte worth of transactions, and once this level of transactions is verified, the miner is eligible for currency in exchange for their work. However, it is important to note that not everyone who does the work will get a reward—completing a block only awards eligibility for a token.
In this way, mining depends on two factors — effort and luck.

Finishing a block is not enough to earn a reward, as you must also be the *first* miner to arrive at the correct answer to the problem. The answer is called a **hash**, or a 64-digit hexadecimal number, and the “correct” hash is the one that is closest (less than or equal to) a target hash. While it seems like it is a long series of guesswork, there are some strategies to reduce the amount of time spent looking for a correct hash. There are trillions of possible combinations for a hash, so finding an efficient machine is essential to achieving any level of success.
