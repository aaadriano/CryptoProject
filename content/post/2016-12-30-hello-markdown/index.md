Quantum computers were designed with the main goal of massive speedups to computational problems. Whereas the common computer (we will call this “classic”) thinks about all its inputs and outputs in terms of 1s or 0s, a quantum computer can interpret information about objects that can be 1 or 0 simultaneously. 

*How?*

The term “quantum” may sound like a vaguely familiar physics term when discussing things at their smallest level, and quantum computing is so-named because the computer borrows this ability of subatomic particles to exist in more than one state. To explain how this works, we need to consider two definitions: 

1)	In a joint quantum system, **superposition** is a state which, in coordinates, can be expressed as a complex projective linear combination of other states. In other words, before measurement, the object has a finite chance of being in each of its possible forms. It is the act of observation that imposes a particular state onto it, because the object does not have any material properties until it is measured.

>> Demonstration: Suppose that we have a coin which is a quantum object. We know that it has two possible states: heads and tails. Let’s say we put the coin into a box. Until we open the box and look at the coin, there is a certain probability that it will show heads, and there is a certain probability that it will show tails, but we won’t know which is it until we observe the coin. The minute we look, the coin with take on a state (let’s pretend our coin shows “heads”) and be converted from a quantum object into a classical object. This means that if we put it back in the box and look at it again, we will only ever see “heads.” The period during which it can be heads or tails is called superposition.

2)	**Entanglement** is a correlation that exists between quantum particles where the observations of two or more quantum particles can be inextricably linked, even if separated. This means that regardless of space or time, you cannot make a measurement of one object without considering the other. Both start as quantum objects, but the act of observation of either one will “collapse” the system, and they will both become classic objects. Neither has a “fixed” value until one of them is observed.
>> Demonstration: You and your best friend each have a quantum coin. You know that the coins are correlated (entangled), so if your coin shows heads, your friend’s coin will also show heads (and vice versa). If your coin shows tails, you know that your friend’s coin is also tails. You take your coin and stand on the South Pole. Your friend sails up to the North Pole. At that moment, you have not yet looked at your coin, so it could be either heads or tails. Your friend calls you and says that they looked at their coin, and it shows “tails”. You know then with certainty, but without looking, that your coin is also “tails.”

Bonus: **Separability** is what we call the opposite of quantum entanglement. When a system is un-entangled, it is possible to assign states to its subsystems and observe only part of the system at a time.

*What does this mean for a quantum computer?*

Classical computers use “bits” to encode information. Quantum computers use “qubits” instead (quantum bit = qubit, get it?). With each qubit that a quantum computer has, its power grows exponentially. Quantum computers are able to function at much greater speeds because instead of considering one possibility at a time, they can try all possible solutions in superposition (or, at the same time).

There are some other differences between classical and quantum computers, but these basics are enough to start a discussion.  A quantum computer’s utility is directly linked to its ability to run complex problems faster than a classical computer. If the problem is simple enough, then there is no benefit to using a quantum computer over its classical brother. In 2019, Google’s quantum computer (Sycamore) was able to outperform the top computer at the IBM summit by a factor of 158. In fact, Sycamore is able to solve a problem in minutes, while its classical counterpart would require 10,000 years. You can learn more about Google’s efforts [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03213-z).

There is no commercially available quantum computer, as their development is long and very expensive. However, quantum technologies are available without having to build the machine yourself. IBM allows access to its computers via the [IBM Quantum Network](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/). IBM plans to have a 1,000-qubit quantum computer in place by 2023.
