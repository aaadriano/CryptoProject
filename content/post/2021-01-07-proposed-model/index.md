Now that we have covered [what cryptocurrency is](https://wucrypto-project.netlify.app/) and [how mining it works](https://wucrypto-project.netlify.app/), we apply our two special tools ([Quantum Computers](https://wucrypto-project.netlify.app/) and [Grover's Algorithm](https://wucrypto-project.netlify.app/)).

**Theory**
We need to find a specific (or smaller) sequence of 64 letters and numbers. Cryptocurrency mining involves  repeatedly changing our guess until we find a sequence that works. On a classic computer, this can only be done using exhaustive, brute force methods. This takes a long time and is difficult to do, hence the high rewards for success.

For each position of the 64, there are 16 possibilities: 0 though 9 and a, b, c, d, e, and f. At the moment, we also know that the first 8 to 64 positions must be "0". As of 08/04/2021, the number of leading zeros is 17. This means that we are realistically trying to compute 48 digits. 

How many combinations is that? Well, you have probability $\frac{1}{16}$ of randomly guessing the first digit correctly. You have a  $\frac{1}{16}$*$\frac{1}{16}$=$\frac{1}{256}$ chance of guessing the first and second digits correctly. From here, we infer that our chances of guessing every digit correctly is $\frac{1}{16^{48}}$, which is a massive, massive number that I am not sure what we can call. For a your typical home computer to find this number, it would take would take thousands of years to mine a new block alone. However, with mining camps and supercomputers, the real number of iterations can be fewer. Nowadays, Bitcoin is designed to be adaptive in difficulty, and one new block is found on average every 10 minutes or 600 seconds. 

Recall, Grover offers us a speedup from for a database of N to âˆšN. Imagine that we can try 0-f on our first digit at the same time. That would require a quantum computer that could consider 48 qubits at a time

We can demonstrate this effect on a classic computer. Suppose we generate our own 64 bit hexadecimal number that follows the rules of a Bitcoin hash. 

*Limitations*

Current iterations of quantum computers have a lot of calculation error. Quantum error correction is required in order to counteract the issue, but it uses a large number of qubits.

Another limitation is specific to Bitcoin. Because miners have become highly specialized, they can be extremely fast compared to even quantum computers. Bitcoin is then relatively resistant to the speedup granted by quantum computers.

Finally, it should be mentioned that we talk about using quantum computers in a **legal** way to honestly mine cryptocurrency. There is a real danger that quantum computers will enable hackers to *steal* finished blocks from individuals with real computers. That is a different type of security problem that is outside the scope of this inquiry.
