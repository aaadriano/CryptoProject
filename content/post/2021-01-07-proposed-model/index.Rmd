Now that we have covered [what cryptocurrency is](https://wucrypto-project.netlify.app/) and [how mining it works](https://wucrypto-project.netlify.app/), we apply our two special tools ([Quantum Computers](https://wucrypto-project.netlify.app/) and [Grover's Algorithm](https://wucrypto-project.netlify.app/)).

**Theory**


Whew. Now that we can build an oracle and run a Grover Algorithm, we can move on to the next portion of this project [here](https://wucrypto-project.netlify.app/).
