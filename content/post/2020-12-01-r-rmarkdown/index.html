<p>Quantum computers have great advantages against classic computers when it comes to financial data. They are able to apply classic algorithms such as Shor’s or Grover’s algorithms with an exponential and quadratic speedup, respectively.</p>
<p>When applied to portfolio optimization, quantum algorithms can serve to help distribute the money between stocks in a way that would help use growth estimates and volatility to develop an investment strategy. Two common methods for funding allocation use adiabatic quantum computing, and quantum amplitude estimation (Rosenberg et al. 2015; Woerner &amp; Egger, 2019). Modeling time dynamics of cryptocurrency price also lends itself to quantum algorithms, and would generate interesting insight through the extension of the Black-Sholes equation into the quantum realm.</p>
<p>This work will focus on Grover’s algorithm, which was developed as a mechanism for searching an unstructured database. Grover’s algorithm is of special interest when discussing cryptocurrency as it demonstrates a threat to cryptographic hashing, and thus to blockchain integrity and block mining. Using Grover’s algorithm, one could match inputs of the same hash values, replacing valid blocks with false ones. Thus, a miner using quantum strategies can mine faster than someone on a classical computer.</p>
<p>However, perhaps the easiest way to use a Quantum Grover is to allow miners to quickly generate solutions for the number that blockchain miners are solving for in order to receive cryptocurrency. This is a very reduced explanation of how mining cryptocurrency works; learn more about mining cryptocurrency <a href="https://wucrypto-project.netlify.app/">here</a></p>
