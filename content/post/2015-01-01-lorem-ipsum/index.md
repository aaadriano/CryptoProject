There is no debate that technological advancements have changed the face of investing. Faster computers first brought electronic markets, complete with automatic ordering, revolutionizing the trading present in the U.S. economy for over a century. The Internet itself was such a disruptive innovation that it had profoundly changed the way the businesses, consumers, and investors all interact, bringing with it lowered fees and a higher level of transparency. 

Information is abundant, so savvy capitalists no longer have to leave their home to do research on companies, securities, and funds. The modern investor can download huge files and mountains of financial records in minutes. They can purchase stocks with the touch of a button. Much of this data is free, and can be found with a simple Google search; the power of the marketplace has been placed squarely into the hands of investors.

We have become comfortable with these technologies, and it is unlikely that anything written above has been particularly surprising. But the Internet has not stopped evolving for efficiency. With growth comes new potential, and the recent interest in quantum computing opens up a cache of new opportunities. While conversations about quantum computing in the financial sphere often revolve around changes to encryption tactics and data security, this paper posits that quantum computers will allow for additional changes to investing. 
Alongside developments to computing, new ways of investing have emerged, powered by more and more powerful machines. Cryptocurrency, specifically, has been an area of great growth and excitement, and the same technologies at enable its existence as that of quantum computers. For a long time, it had been easy to overlook cryptocurrency as a serious investment (Exhibit A: Dogecoin). However, with a new upswing in popularity, cryptocurrency values have been on the rise again. With the crypto-community attracting attention from investors, this project seeks to launch a timely exploration into modeling trends in the world of virtual currency.

This body of work pairs those two exiting innovations together, developing a framework for their mutual growth.  Results from this exploration would have applications in investment, academic, and risk management settings. While contemporaneous-type prediction models hold academic interest, trade-able results require a bit more complexity which could be achieved more easily with the aid of growing technology. Furthering the understanding of cryptocurrency would allow for greater portfolio optimization and risk diversification.
