Bitcoin is built on cryptography, and neither cryptocurrency nor quantum computing are going to be left behind in this technological arms race. Computers are exceptionally useful in helping us solve difficult computational problems, and cryptocurrency mining is no different. The benefits (and threats) of quantum computing on searching and code breaking should not be undervalued, and as this technology continues to grow, so will the opportunities.

At the moment, quantum Bitcoin mining has some limitations, but by 2025 these devices will not only be more accessible, but will also have very fast quantum hash rates for a greater number of qubits. Even at today's computational level, a quantum computer could give someone a 200% increase to their success rate in cryptocurrency mining. There is enormous potential in these devices, and the responsibility is on us to use them responsibly.

Cryptocurrency is here to stay. The future will be such where quantum technologies are commonplace, spurring the reinvention of blockchain and transaction chain technologies via quantum cryptography. It is certainly an exciting endeavor, and I look forward to seeing how these technologies involve in tandem.
