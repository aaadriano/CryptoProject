"It is well-known that the heart of Bitcoin is
cryptography [1], and quantum computers are particularly good at difficult problems like
searching and code breaking. This opens up many questions regarding how quantum 
computing is going to impact Bitcoin. "
For quantum mining, the quantum advantage is limited, hence very fast
quantum hash rates would be required. F

Looking into the future, one can imagine a quantum arms race between exotic forms of
cryptography and quantum algorithms to break them. In such a scenario, the development of
Qubitcoins -- quantum versions of Bitcoin that are based on quantum mechanics -- will
become a real necessity. In a future where quantum technologies are commonplace it will
make the most sense to re-invent the blockchain and transaction chain with the methods of
quantum cryptography.
